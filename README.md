This program can perform a simple log in test to GameFAQs.com, but that is only to demonstrate a log in test.

The primary feature of this program is to perform tests on www.hiyokojisho.com, a web app created by Andrew Tae. Hiyoko Jisho is a web app that allows users to search for words in English or by using Kanji to look up dictionary terms in Japanese.  It also allows them to utilize their search results to build kanji based on search results to create compound kanji. This app tests many of the primary features of HiyokoJisho, including:
  - Search Bar
  - History
  - External Link Verification
  - Page Text Verification
  - Search Logic
  - Clear Logic
  - and so on.
  
  The app will create a .json file, an html report, and log file based on test results for documentation.
